# chat-app
 chat-app is a chatting application built with Node v3 and Socket Programming. It allows users to chat with one another in a fun chat room. The application provides a join page at the beginning, which requires a display name and a room name. Display name is the chat name that is associated with your user. The room name serves as the object that defines your room. It helps to think of it as a password for your room. In order for users to join the same chat rooms, they must have identical room names.
